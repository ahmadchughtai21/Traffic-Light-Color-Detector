### Traffic Light Color Detector

#### Description:
This C++ program serves as a simple traffic light color detector. It prompts the user to input a color (case-insensitive), and based on the input, it identifies the corresponding traffic light color. The program recognizes the colors red, green, and yellow, providing a message indicating the detected color. If the input is not one of these specified colors, the program prompts the user to enter either "Red," "Green," or "Yellow."

#### How to Use:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter a color when prompted.

#### Sample Outputs:
1. Input: "Red"
   Output: "The light is Red"

2. Input: "green"
   Output: "The light is Green"

3. Input: "Yellow"
   Output: "The light is Yellow"

4. Input: "blue"
   Output: "Enter Red, Yellow, or Green!"
